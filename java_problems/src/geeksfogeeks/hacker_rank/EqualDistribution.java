//
//        Nancy has N boxes which contains some chocolates. She wants to distribute maximum number of chocolates equally
//        among her K friends by selecting a consecutive sequence of boxes . Help Nancy in finding the maximum number of
//        chocolates she can give to each of her friend.
//        Note: She cannot cut a chocolate into pieces, and every friend should receive equal number of chocolates
//        Input:
//        First line of input contains T number of test cases. For each test case, there will be 2 lines. First line
//        contains two space seperated integers N and K . N denotes the number of boxes and K denotes number of Nancy's
//        friends. Second line contains N space separated integers denoting number of chocolates in each box.
//        Output:
//        For each test case , print the maximum number of chocolates she can give to each of her friend.
//        Your Task:
//        Since it is a functional problem , you don't need to take input just complete the  function maxNumOfChocolates()
//        which accepts an array arr of integer , size of the array n, integer value k  and returns maximum number of
//        chocolates she can give to each of her friend.
//        Constraints:
//        1 <= T <= 30
//        2 <= N <= 104
//        1 <= K <= 103
//        1 <= arr[i] <= 100
//        Example:
//        Input:
//        2
//        6 3
//        2 7 6 1 4 5
//        4 2
//        1 2 3 4
//        Output:
//        6
//        5
//        Explanation:
//        Testcase1: The subarray is 7, 6, 1, 4 with sum 18 and Equal distribution of 18 chocolates among 3 friends is 6.
